# paper-ops

PaperOps is academic paper search tooling built for local, source-aware literature discovery. Run one search string across Scopus, IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar, SciELO, and Web of Science, combine official API-backed retrieval with browser-driven extraction where needed, deduplicate the results, and save both a readable report and a machine-readable JSON export.

This project was developed using [career-ops](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) as its base. `paper-ops` reworks that operational foundation for academic paper discovery instead of job-search workflows.

## Credits

- Base project and operational inspiration: [santifer/career-ops](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops)
- `paper-ops` adapts that foundation to a literature-search workflow centered on Scopus, IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar, SciELO, and Web of Science

## What It Does

- **Hybrid Input:** Accepts raw Boolean search strings or **Research Profile Markdown files**.
- **Automated Query Generation:** Converts research profiles into robust Boolean search queries.
- **Multi-Source Discovery:** Queries Scopus, IEEE, ACM, Google Scholar, SciELO, and Web of Science through a shared adapter contract.
- Uses official APIs for Scopus, IEEE, and Web of Science when keys are configured
- Uses the free SciELO JSON API without authentication
- Uses browser-driven extraction for ACM and Google Scholar
- Normalizes results into a common `PaperRecord` shape
- Deduplicates by DOI, then source identity, then title plus year
- Enriches each record with PDF availability plus a direct PDF URL when it can be detected
- Downloads accessible PDFs from saved search results
- Extracts text from downloaded PDFs when available
- OCRs scanned PDFs into reusable text artifacts when OCRmyPDF is installed
- Falls back to saved abstracts or landing-page abstracts when a PDF is not available
- Uses a fast HTML fetch first and can fall back to Playwright on the article page for dynamic abstracts
- Builds a local SQLite RAG database from saved articles and extracted text
- Answers targeted questions using indexed chunks, SQLite FTS/BM25 retrieval, optional semantic embeddings, hybrid retrieval, and verified supporting evidence
- Exports evidence tables, ABNT/BibTeX/APA references, literature matrices, and sourced draft sections
- Generates structured per-article summaries and cross-paper digests (incorporates research profile context)
- Saves one markdown report and one JSON export per run
- Maintains a lightweight search history index
- Supports queue and batch processing for repeated searches
- Uses Playwright plus Chromium for live source browsing and extraction

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- `npm`
- Chromium for Playwright-driven sources
- Optional: OCRmyPDF/Tesseract for scanned PDF OCR
- Optional: Gemini CLI for the interactive Gemini-first workflow

## Dependencies

This project does require local dependencies before you can run live or fixture searches.

Required setup:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

What each command does:

- `npm install` installs the Node.js runtime dependencies declared in [package.json](D:/workspace/paper-ops/package.json), including `playwright`, `pdf-parse`, and `better-sqlite3`
- `npx playwright install chromium` installs the Chromium browser binary used by browser-driven sources such as ACM and Google Scholar

Optional setup:

- install `gemini` in your shell if you want the interactive Gemini CLI workflow
- install `gemini` if you want `summarize`, `digest`, and `ask`, because those flows use Gemini CLI as the AI runtime by default
- run `npm link` if you want to call `paper-ops` as a global local command instead of `node paper-ops.mjs`

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoaopauloRM700/paper-ops.git
cd paper-ops

# Install required dependencies
npm install
npx playwright install chromium

# Create local credentials
copy .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your real keys

# Inspect environment readiness
node doctor.mjs

# Gemini-first interactive usage
gemini
# Then type:
# paper-ops search "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\""

# One-shot Gemini usage from the terminal
node paper-ops-gemini.mjs search "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\"" --fixtures

# Direct local runtime usage
node paper-ops.mjs search "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\"" --fixtures

# Download PDFs and build summaries from saved results
node paper-ops.mjs fetch-pdfs "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\""
node paper-ops.mjs summarize "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\""
node paper-ops.mjs digest "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\""

# Or treat raw query text as a search command
node paper-ops.mjs "\"knowledge graph\" AND screening" --fixtures
```

### Research Profiles (Markdown)

You can perform searches using a structured Markdown file instead of a raw search string. This allows you to maintain research context and keywords in a single document.

Example `my-research.md`:

```md
# Projeto/Pesquisa
- Systematic Review: Automated Exploratory Testing by Intelligent Agents

# Abordagem / Detalhe
- Agents that navigate autonomously in web applications
- Reinforcement Learning for state space exploration

# Palavras-chave
- autonomous UI exploration, intelligent agents testing
- reinforcement learning testing, RL-based exploration
```

When you use a Markdown file as input:
1. **Query Generation:** It automatically generates a Boolean query by OR-ing terms within a line and AND-ing the lines.
2. **Contextual AI:** The "Project" and "Approach" details are passed to the AI during `summarize` and `digest` phases to provide more relevant insights.
3. **Smart Naming:** Reports and search history use the project title from the Markdown file instead of the long search string.

Usage:
```bash
node paper-ops.mjs search my-research.md
node paper-ops.mjs summarize my-research.md
```

## Usage

```text
node paper-ops.mjs ...       -> Direct local runtime
gemini                       -> Open Gemini CLI in this repository
paper-ops-gemini <command>   -> One-shot Gemini prompt through the paper-ops router
paper-ops search "<query>"   -> Run a multi-source search and save artifacts
paper-ops fetch-pdfs "<query>" -> Download PDFs from saved results for one query
paper-ops summarize "<query>" -> Use PDF text or abstract fallback to write structured article summaries
paper-ops digest "<query>"   -> Generate a consolidated digest for one saved query
paper-ops ocr "<query>"      -> OCR cached/downloadable PDFs for one saved query
paper-ops db init            -> Initialize the local SQLite RAG database
paper-ops catalog sync capes -> Synchronize CAPES/Sucupira production metadata
paper-ops index "<query>"    -> Build a local RAG index from saved PDFs/text/abstracts
paper-ops embed "<query>"    -> Generate semantic embeddings for indexed chunks
paper-ops ask "<query>" --question "<question>" -> Answer from the local RAG index with evidence
paper-ops ask "<query>" --question "<question>" --retrieval hybrid --embed -> Answer with BM25 + semantic retrieval
paper-ops ask "<query>" --question "<question>" --refresh-text --refresh-index -> Regenerate cached text/index first
paper-ops evidence "<query>" --question "<question>" -> Export retrieved evidence chunks
paper-ops references "<query>" --format all -> Export ABNT, BibTeX, and APA references
paper-ops matrix "<query>"   -> Export a literature matrix for one saved query
paper-ops draft "<query>" --section related-work --question "<focus>" -> Draft a sourced section
paper-ops csv "<query>"      -> Export a deduplicated CSV from saved results for one search string
paper-ops <query>            -> Treat raw query text as a search command
paper-ops pipeline           -> Process queued searches from data/search-queue.md
paper-ops tracker            -> Print the search history index
paper-ops batch              -> Process batch/batch-input.tsv
```

`paper-ops.mjs` remains the local runtime. In Gemini-first usage, the agent should invoke that runtime and present the saved-search summary directly in the terminal.

For resumable shell-based batch orchestration with logs and state tracking:

```bash
bash batch/batch-runner.sh --fixtures
```

## Configuration

The main config surface is `config/sources.yml`. It is stored as JSON-compatible YAML so it stays dependency-free and easy to edit.

### Result limits per source

The number of articles returned per source is controlled in [sources.yml](D:/workspace/paper-ops/config/sources.yml).

You have two levels of control:

- `defaults.per_source_limit` sets the global default used by every source
- `sources.<source>.limit` optionally overrides that default for one specific source

Example:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "per_source_limit": 20
  },
  "sources": {
    "google_scholar": {
      "limit": 30
    }
  }
}
```

This limit is applied per source in each search run:

- `scopus` returns up to that many records
- `ieee` returns up to that many records
- `acm` returns up to that many records
- `google_scholar` now paginates across Scholar result pages until it reaches that limit or runs out of results
- `scielo` returns up to that many records from the SciELO JSON API
- `web_of_science` returns up to that many records from the configured Web of Science API endpoint

For Google Scholar, you can also tune pagination behavior with:

- `sources.google_scholar.max_pages`
- `sources.google_scholar.page_delay_ms`

Each source supports:

- `enabled`
- `mode`: `api`, `live`, or `fixture`
- `limit` to override the global per-source result limit
- `api_url` for official API-backed retrieval
- `search_url` for live browser navigation
- `fixture` for local fixture-backed testing
- `experimental` for best-effort adapters like Google Scholar

### Academic quality filters and venue ranking

Searches can classify, filter, and rank records by publication type and academic venue evidence. The repository configuration enables strict filtering by default for:

- journal articles
- review articles
- conference papers

The quality policy is configured under `quality` in `config/sources.yml`:

```json
{
  "quality": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "strict",
    "allowed_publication_types": ["journal_article", "review", "conference_paper"],
    "allow_unknown_types": false,
    "minimum_score": 40,
    "capes_production_cache": "data/catalogs/capes/productions.jsonl",
    "catalogs": {
      "scielo_journals": "docs/journals_areas_2026-09-29_19-15-23.csv",
      "doaj_journals": "docs/doaj_journalcsv_20260830_2320_utf8.csv",
      "capes_qualis": "config/capes-qualis.csv",
      "core_conferences": "config/core-conferences.csv"
    }
  }
}
```

Per-search overrides are available:

```bash
paper-ops search "retrieval augmented generation" --quality-mode strict --types journal-article,review,conference-paper
paper-ops search "retrieval augmented generation" --quality-mode prioritize
paper-ops search "retrieval augmented generation" --quality-mode off
paper-ops search "retrieval augmented generation" --min-quality-score 65
```

CAPES/Sucupira production metadata can be synchronized separately:

```bash
paper-ops catalog sync capes
paper-ops catalog sync capes --year 2024 --page-size 100 --max-pages 25
```

The command discovers valid API facets, defaults to the newest available year, requests bibliographic journal articles and proceedings papers, and writes an atomic local snapshot plus a provenance manifest under `data/catalogs/capes/`. `--max-pages` is a safety boundary; the manifest reports `truncated: true` when additional pages may exist. Re-running a year replaces that year's cached rows while preserving other synchronized years.

Searches match this cache by exact normalized article title plus year. A match adds `capes_production_registered`; it never sets `capes_validated`, because production registration and Qualis venue classification are different claims.

`strict` removes disallowed publication types and records below the minimum score. `prioritize` retains all records and only changes their ordering. The score records its reasons and catalog matches in `academic_quality`, so the ranking remains inspectable.

Catalog matching prefers ISSN/eISSN and falls back to an exact normalized venue title or conference acronym. Import templates are available at `config/capes-qualis.example.csv` and `config/core-conferences.example.csv`.

The bundled `docs/journals_areas_2026-09-29_19-15-23.csv` is treated as a SciELO title/activity catalog. The DOAJ export in `docs/doaj_journalcsv_20260830_2320_utf8.csv` supplies international journal title, ISSN/eISSN, and peer-review evidence. Neither catalog is labeled as CAPES or Qualis data. Likewise, `docs/br-capes-acessos-portal-periodicos-2025-2026-06-01.xlsx` contains institutional Portal usage metrics and is not used to score individual venues.

API keys are resolved in this order:

1. process environment variables such as `SCOPUS_API_KEY`, `IEEE_API_KEY`, and `WEB_OF_SCIENCE_API_KEY`
2. local `.env`
3. local `config/keys.txt` fallback

Additional optional environment variables for summarization:

- `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_CLI` to override the summarization command, default `gemini`
- `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_MS` to change the summarization timeout
- `PAPER_OPS_OCR_LANG` to set the default OCR language, for example `por+eng`
- `PAPER_OPS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` to select `openai` or `fixture`
- `PAPER_OPS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` to select an embedding model, for example `text-embedding-3-small`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` when using the `openai` embedding provider

## CSV Export

If you already have saved JSON exports in `output/`, you can generate a deduplicated CSV for one specific search string:

```bash
paper-ops csv "\"software testing\" AND ai"
```

This export:

- reads saved `.json` search results from `output/`
- filters them by the requested search string
- combines only matching runs
- deduplicates the combined records
- writes a CSV back into `output/`

There are also two helper scripts:

```bash
node json_to_csv.mjs "\"software testing\" AND ai"
node consolidate_all.mjs
```

- `json_to_csv.mjs` exports one CSV for one query
- `consolidate_all.mjs` generates one CSV per distinct saved query

## Output Model

Every saved result uses the normalized `PaperRecord` shape:

```json
{
  "source": "scopus",
  "source_id": "SCOPUS-ALPHA",
  "title": "Evidence Mapping with RAG Pipelines",
  "authors": ["Ada Lovelace"],
  "year": 2024,
  "venue": "Journal of Evidence Automation",
  "publication_type": "journal_article",
  "doi": "10.1000/alpha",
  "url": "https://example.org/paper",
  "abstract": "Paper abstract",
  "pdf_available": true,
  "pdf_url": "https://example.org/paper.pdf",
  "matched_query": "\"systematic review\" AND rag",
  "retrieved_at": "2026-04-17T15:00:00.000Z",
  "academic_quality": {
    "score": 84,
    "tier": "strong",
    "capes_validated": false,
    "scielo_indexed": true,
    "doaj_indexed": false,
    "catalog_matches": []
  }
}
```

Saved artifacts:

- `reports/<run-id>.md`
- `output/<run-id>.json`
- `data/search-history.md`
- `data/paper-ops.sqlite`

Derived PDF and summary artifacts:

- `output/pdfs/<article-id>.pdf`
- `output/pdf-text/<article-id>.txt`
- `output/ocr-pdfs/<article-id>.pdf`
- `output/ocr-text/<article-id>.txt`
- `output/article-summaries/<article-id>.json`
- `output/article-summaries/<article-id>.txt`
- `reports/article-summaries/<article-id>.md`
- `output/digests/<run-id>.json`
- `reports/digests/<run-id>.md`
- `output/answers/<run-id>.json`
- `reports/answers/<run-id>.md`
- `output/rag/<query-id>/answers/*.json`
- `output/rag/<query-id>/evidence/*.json`
- `reports/rag/<query-id>/answers/*.md`
- `reports/rag/<query-id>/evidence/*.md`
- `reports/rag/<query-id>/references/*`
- `reports/rag/<query-id>/matrix.*`
- `reports/rag/<query-id>/drafts/*.md`

## PDF Reading and Summaries

The search runtime saves metadata first. PDF reading and summarization run as follow-up commands on one saved search string:

```bash
paper-ops fetch-pdfs "\"software testing\" AND ai"
paper-ops summarize "\"software testing\" AND ai"
paper-ops digest "\"software testing\" AND ai"
paper-ops ocr "\"software testing\" AND ai" --ocr-lang por+eng
paper-ops index "\"software testing\" AND ai"
paper-ops embed "\"software testing\" AND ai" --embedding-provider openai --embedding-model text-embedding-3-small
paper-ops ask "\"software testing\" AND ai" --question "What methods are used?"
paper-ops ask "\"software testing\" AND ai" --question "What methods are used?" --retrieval hybrid --embed
paper-ops evidence "\"software testing\" AND ai" --question "What methods are used?"
paper-ops evidence "\"software testing\" AND ai" --question "What methods are used?" --retrieval semantic --embed
paper-ops references "\"software testing\" AND ai" --format all
paper-ops matrix "\"software testing\" AND ai"
paper-ops draft "\"software testing\" AND ai" --section related-work --question "What methods are used?"
paper-ops ask "\"software testing\" AND ai" --question "What methods are used?" --refresh-text --refresh-index
```

Workflow:

- `fetch-pdfs` downloads direct PDF links already discovered in saved search results
- `summarize` reuses cached PDFs when present, otherwise falls back to a saved abstract or an abstract enriched from the article landing page
- `digest` reuses those article summaries and generates a cross-paper digest for the whole search string
- `ocr` creates OCR PDF/text artifacts for scanned or image-heavy PDFs without overwriting the originals
- `index` reuses or creates extracted text, prefers OCR text when `--ocr` is enabled, chunks it by page, and stores articles/chunks/references in `data/paper-ops.sqlite`
- `embed` stores semantic vectors for indexed chunks
- `ask` retrieves top chunks from SQLite FTS/BM25, semantic embeddings, or hybrid retrieval and answers only from that indexed evidence
- `evidence`, `references`, `matrix`, and `draft` reuse the local RAG database for writing support
- add `--refresh-text` to regenerate cached `output/pdf-text/*.txt` files with the current extractor
- add `--refresh-index` to rebuild indexed chunks for a saved query
- add `--refresh-embeddings` to rebuild semantic vectors for indexed chunks

Current scope:

- PDFs should be directly accessible and text-based when available
- when no PDF is available, `summarize` and `ask` fall back to the saved `abstract` field or a landing-page abstract
- if a direct HTML fetch is not enough, the runtime can use Playwright on the article page to wait for rendering and try simple interactions such as expanding the abstract
- scanned/image-only PDFs require OCRmyPDF/Tesseract and `paper-ops ocr` or `--ocr`
- semantic retrieval requires embeddings via `paper-ops embed` or `--embed`; BM25 remains the default fallback
- `summarize`, `digest`, and `ask` require Gemini CLI by default unless you override `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_CLI`

## Validation

```bash
npm test
node test-all.mjs
node doctor.mjs
node verify.mjs
npm run search:smoke
```

## Notes

- The dependency installation step is mandatory. Without `npm install`, the repo has no `playwright`, `pdf-parse`, or `better-sqlite3`; without `npx playwright install chromium`, browser-driven sources will fail.
- Scopus, IEEE, and Web of Science now default to official API-backed retrieval when local keys are available.
   IEEE Xplore API: https://developer.ieee.org/docs
   Elsevier Research Products APIs : https://dev.elsevier.com/
- Web of Science uses `WEB_OF_SCIENCE_API_KEY` or `WOS_API_KEY`; the API URL can be tuned in `config/sources.yml` if your Clarivate subscription exposes a different endpoint.
- Web of Science raw search strings are sent as topic searches, `TS=(...)`; set `sources.web_of_science.raw_query` to `true` if you want to pass an advanced Web of Science query unchanged.
- `.env.example` is the tracked template. `.env` is local-only and ignored by git.
- SciELO uses the free `search.scielo.org` JSON API and does not require authentication.
- ACM and Google Scholar remain browser-driven.
- Google Scholar is still experimental and best-effort, but it now paginates through Scholar result pages to honor `per_source_limit` more accurately.
- Pipeline and batch runs now avoid artifact-name collisions when the same query appears more than once in the same execution.
- Search-history links are now written relative to `data/search-history.md`, so the markdown links resolve correctly when opened directly.
- Fixture mode remains the primary verification path for tests and smoke checks.
- `pdf_available` is `true` when a PDF link is found, `false` when a source explicitly indicates no PDF, and `null` when availability could not be confirmed.
- Search runs now render a terminal summary with source coverage, top results, PDF status, and artifact paths in addition to saving `.md` and `.json` files.
