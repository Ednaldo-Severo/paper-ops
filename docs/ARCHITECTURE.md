- `reports/rag/<query-id>/**` -> RAG answer, evidence, reference, matrix, and draft reports

## Dedup Order

1. DOI exact match
2. Source ID / source URL identity
3. Normalized title plus year

When duplicates are merged, the first retained record is enriched with any missing metadata discovered later, including `pdf_available` and `pdf_url`.

## Academic Quality Policy

1. Deduplicated records are classified as journal articles, reviews, conference papers, preprints, books, theses, or unknown types.
2. Explicit source metadata is preferred; venue/title heuristics are the fallback.
3. Configured catalogs are matched by ISSN/eISSN first, then normalized title or conference acronym.
4. CAPES/Qualis, SciELO, and international venue rankings remain separate evidence signals.
5. `strict` mode filters by type and minimum score; `prioritize` mode only sorts by score.
6. Every saved record exposes the score, tier, reasons, and catalog matches used in ranking.
7. CAPES production-cache matches use exact normalized title plus year and remain separate from CAPES/Qualis venue validation.

## Live Search Model

- Fixture mode uses local JSON fixtures for deterministic tests
- API mode uses official metadata/search endpoints for supported sources
- Live mode launches one shared Playwright Chromium runtime per search run
- Each source adapter builds its own search URL and extracts visible article metadata from the result page
- Current default API-mode sources are Scopus, IEEE, SciELO, and Web of Science
- Current default live browser sources are ACM and Google Scholar
- Browser failures are isolated per source so one blocked site does not fail the entire search run
- Summary workflows use the best available text source in this order:
  - extracted PDF text
  - saved abstract from the normalized `PaperRecord`
  - abstract enriched from the article landing page
- Landing-page enrichment first tries a direct HTML fetch and then falls back to Playwright for dynamic pages, including lightweight interactions such as opening an abstract panel or dismissing cookie banners.
- `paper-ops index` creates/updates the local SQLite RAG index for one saved query.
- `paper-ops ocr` OCRs cached/downloadable PDFs for one saved query and preserves OCR artifacts separately.
- `paper-ops embed` creates chunk embeddings for semantic retrieval.
- RAG indexing stores article metadata, extracted documents, page-aware chunks, references, and an FTS5 table for BM25 retrieval.
- `paper-ops ask` creates the index on demand when needed, retrieves top evidence chunks with BM25, semantic, or hybrid retrieval, and writes verified evidence to both SQLite and artifacts.
- `paper-ops evidence`, `references`, `matrix`, and `draft` reuse the same local database for writing workflows.
- Embeddings are stored locally in SQLite for V1 semantic retrieval. Hybrid retrieval combines BM25 and semantic ranks with reciprocal rank fusion.
