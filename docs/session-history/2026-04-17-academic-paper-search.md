# Session History: Academic Paper Search Replatform

**Date:** 2026-04-17
**Project:** `paper-ops`
**Working directory:** `D:\workspace\paper-ops`

## Why This Repo Exists

This project was split out as a new standalone repository after the original inherited workspace was confirmed to be a separate, dirty job-search project with unrelated changes.

The user explicitly redirected the work from "adapt the existing repo in place" to:

- create a completely new project
- use the academic-paper-search plan as the base
- prepare it for eventual GitHub publishing under `JoaopauloRM700`

## Locked Decisions

- Project name: `paper-ops`
- Target environment: Gemini CLI first
- Public router: `paper-ops`
- V1 output: saved result set
- Primary sources: Scopus, IEEE, ACM
- Google Scholar: experimental, non-blocking, disabled by default in live mode
- Config surface: `config/sources.yml`
- Normalized record shape: `PaperRecord`

## Implementation Actions Completed

1. Created a fresh standalone project directory: `D:\workspace\paper-ops`
2. Initialized a new git repository on `main`
3. Added red tests first for:
   - `PaperRecord` normalization
   - deduplication behavior
   - CLI routing behavior
   - fixture-backed search run persistence
   - missing-credential partial success behavior
4. Verified the initial red failure
5. Implemented:
   - config loading
   - source adapters
   - deduplication
   - artifact writing
   - queue and batch helpers
   - CLI entrypoint
   - doctor/verify scripts
6. Re-ran tests to green
7. Added project docs, mode files, Codex/Gemini entrypoints, and plugin metadata

## Current State

Core runtime exists and passes the current test suite.

Artifacts now supported:

- `reports/*.md`
- `output/*.json`
- `data/search-history.md`
- `data/search-queue.md`

## Verification Evidence

The following commands were run successfully in the new repository:

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
node paper-ops.mjs search "\"systematic review\" AND \"retrieval augmented generation\"" --fixtures
node verify.mjs
```

Observed results:

- 5 tests passed, 0 failed
- doctor checks passed
- fixture-backed smoke search wrote a markdown report and JSON export
- search-history link verification passed
- a disposable temp-project smoke run also passed without polluting the repo commit scope

## Remaining Blockers

- `gh` is not installed in the environment, so automated GitHub repo creation / PR workflows are currently blocked
- Pushing to `https://github.com/JoaopauloRM700` will require either:
  - `gh` installed and authenticated, or
  - an existing remote repo plus authenticated git push access
- The local repo remote was configured as `https://github.com/JoaopauloRM700/paper-ops.git`
- An earlier direct push attempt reached GitHub and failed with `Repository not found`
- The repository was later created or made accessible, and push to branch `Workspace` succeeded

## Next Steps

1. Continue implementation on branch `Workspace`
2. Optionally install/authenticate `gh` for future GitHub automation
3. Create additional commits and push them to `origin/Workspace`

## Original Repo Evaluation

The original `D:\workspace\article researcher` repo was re-evaluated as a transplant source after the standalone `paper-ops` scaffold was created.

### High-value transplant candidates

1. **Batch orchestrator design**
   - Source: `batch/batch-runner.sh`
   - Why: It already has lock files, resumable state, retry handling, agent autodetection, per-item logs, and parallel worker orchestration.
   - Relevance to `paper-ops`: strong fit for batch processing many search strings or source URLs.

2. **Comprehensive verification harness**
   - Source: `test-all.mjs`
   - Why: It checks syntax, script execution, build health, data contract assumptions, and repo hygiene in one place.
   - Relevance to `paper-ops`: strong fit, but should be adapted to search-specific artifacts instead of job-search files.

3. **Doctor/setup ergonomics**
   - Source: `doctor.mjs`
   - Why: Better UX than the current minimal `paper-ops` doctor script.
   - Relevance to `paper-ops`: medium-high fit if rewritten around source credentials, config, and optional dependencies.

4. **Plugin and router integration pattern**
   - Source: plugin skill files and OpenCode command wrappers
   - Why: The original repo has a fuller multi-surface integration story across Codex, Gemini, Claude, and OpenCode.
   - Relevance to `paper-ops`: high fit, especially if multi-agent prompt surfaces matter.

5. **Dashboard architecture pattern**
   - Source: `dashboard/`
   - Why: The Bubble Tea TUI is structurally reusable even though the current data model is job-search-specific.
   - Relevance to `paper-ops`: medium fit for a later phase; not worth transplanting before the search runtime matures.

### Low-value or avoid-for-now transplants

- Job-evaluation modes and prompts
- CV/PDF generation pipeline
- Tracker merge/status scripts tied to application workflows
- Any onboarding/data-contract assumptions centered on CVs, job portals, or recruiting actions

### Conclusion

The original repo is worth using as an **operational scaffolding source**, not as a domain-logic source.

The best next transplants into `paper-ops` are:

1. batch orchestration
2. richer repo-wide verification
3. improved doctor/setup checks
4. optional multi-surface command/plugin wrappers

## Transferred Files Review and Remediation

After the indicated files were copied from the original repo into `paper-ops`, the project was reviewed again to identify which transfers were useful and which ones reintroduced stale `career-ops` behavior.

### Problems found

1. `doctor.mjs` had been overwritten with job-search onboarding checks (`cv.md`, `profile.yml`, `portals.yml`, fonts, Playwright).
2. The Codex plugin metadata and skill file had reverted from `paper-ops` back to `career-ops`.
3. `batch/batch-runner.sh`, `batch/batch-prompt.md`, and `batch/worker-output.schema.json` were copied over in job-offer form.
4. `test-all.mjs` had been copied over as a career-search validation suite instead of a paper-search validation suite.
5. Some public-facing text files had encoding artifacts after the file transfer.

### Adjustments made

1. Restored the plugin metadata and skill file so the public Codex surface is once again `paper-ops`.
2. Rewrote `doctor.mjs` around the actual `paper-ops` contract:
   - config parsing
   - required directories
   - fixture presence
   - batch asset presence
   - plugin surface presence
   - optional agent CLI detection
   - warning-only checks for missing live API credentials
3. Rewrote `test-all.mjs` into a repo-level validation suite for:
   - syntax
   - required files
   - stale `career-ops` term regressions on active public files
   - unit tests
   - doctor
   - verify
   - fixture-backed smoke search
   - batch runner shell syntax
4. Reworked the transferred batch files so they now describe and execute batch literature searches rather than batch job-offer evaluation.
5. Normalized transferred public text back to ASCII where practical and fixed `_shared.md`.
6. Updated `.gitignore` for runtime-generated batch and data artifacts.
7. Exposed `test:all` in `package.json` and documented the shell batch runner in `README.md`.

### Deferred

- `dashboard/` remains a deferred transplant candidate.
- It is still structurally useful, but its model and imports are still tied to the old job-search domain and were intentionally left out of the active verification surface for now.

### Verification after remediation

The adjusted runtime and repo-level checks were rerun successfully:

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
node verify.mjs
node test-all.mjs
```

Observed results:

- unit tests: 5 passed, 0 failed
- `doctor.mjs`: passed with warning-only missing credential notices for live Scopus and IEEE keys
- `verify.mjs`: passed
- `test-all.mjs`: 51 passed, 0 failed, 2 warnings

Current warnings are expected:

1. live API credentials are not set locally for Scopus and IEEE
2. `dashboard/` is still present only as a deferred transplant candidate, not an active verified surface

## Branch Transition

The reviewed remediation work is being moved off `Workspace` into a new development branch so the legacy branch can be removed cleanly.

Intent:

1. create a new branch for the transferred-file remediation work
2. commit the current `paper-ops` adjustments there
3. delete `Workspace` after the replacement branch is established

## Browser-Driven Live Search Pivot

The project direction was clarified after implementation had already assumed API-backed live sources for Scopus and IEEE.

### Correction from the user

- Live searches should not depend on source APIs
- Searches should be performed in web browsers
- Result links and article metadata should be extracted from the source result pages
- This applies to all configured sources, including ACM and Google Scholar

### Implementation changes

1. Added `playwright` as the runtime dependency for live browser automation.
2. Replaced API-era live-source assumptions in config with browser `search_url` settings.
3. Added a shared Playwright browser runtime:
   - one browser per search run
   - one page per source search
   - browser lifecycle managed in `search-runner`
4. Reworked all live adapters to build source-specific search URLs and extract visible metadata from browser-loaded result pages.
5. Kept fixture mode as the primary automated verification path.
6. Reworked doctor checks to validate Playwright plus Chromium availability instead of API credentials.
7. Added browser-oriented tests for:
   - per-source result extraction
   - browser live mode without API keys
   - graceful skipping when the browser runtime cannot start

### Updated verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
```

Observed results after the browser pivot:

- 7 tests passed, 0 failed
- `doctor.mjs` passed with Playwright and Chromium detected

## PDF Availability Enrichment

The result model was extended so each normalized `PaperRecord` now also carries:

- `pdf_available`
- `pdf_url`

### Behavior

1. Fixture-backed and browser-driven adapters now attempt to detect direct PDF links per source.
2. IEEE and ACM currently populate direct PDF URLs from both fixtures and browser result pages where available.
3. Scopus and Google Scholar default to `null` PDF availability when the result page does not expose a reliable PDF link.
4. Deduplication now enriches the retained canonical record with PDF metadata discovered on later duplicate records instead of discarding that metadata.
5. Markdown reports now include `PDF Available` and `PDF URL` columns, and JSON exports include both fields in each record.

### Verification evidence

The PDF enrichment changes were implemented test-first and verified with:

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/dedup.test.mjs tests/browser-adapters.test.mjs tests/search-runner.test.mjs
```

Observed results:

- 7 targeted tests passed, 0 failed

## Gemini-First Terminal Surface Restoration

The original project expectation was clarified further: the repo should not only have a local runtime, it should also feel operationally agent-first in the terminal, especially through Gemini CLI.

### Problem

The earlier `paper-ops` implementation had the search engine and saved artifacts, but it still behaved mainly like a direct Node CLI:

- `paper-ops.mjs` only printed artifact paths
- the Gemini-facing docs existed, but the interactive/router-style experience from the original project had not been fully restored
- there was no explicit one-shot Gemini wrapper surface

### Adjustments made

1. Added terminal rendering helpers so `paper-ops` now prints:
   - search summary
   - source coverage
   - top results
   - PDF status
   - artifact paths
2. Added `paper-ops-gemini.mjs` plus package bin wiring as an explicit one-shot Gemini wrapper.
3. Enriched `GEMINI.md`, `README.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`, and mode files so the Gemini usage path now mirrors the operational style of the original repository more closely.
4. Updated `doctor.mjs` to report Gemini CLI availability explicitly instead of only reporting generic agent CLI detection.
5. Added red-first tests for:
   - terminal summary rendering through `main()`
   - Gemini prompt canonicalization for one-shot wrapper usage

### Verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
node verify.mjs
node test-all.mjs
npm run search:smoke
```

Observed results:

- 9 unit/integration tests passed, 0 failed
- `doctor.mjs` passed with 1 warning because Gemini CLI is not installed in the current environment PATH
- `test-all.mjs` passed with 2 warnings:
  - Gemini CLI missing locally
  - `dashboard/` still deferred

## IEEE and Scopus API Pivot

Live browser extraction proved unreliable for Scopus and IEEE in the current environment, while the user later supplied official API keys for both systems through `config/keys.txt`.

### Decision

The runtime now uses a hybrid source model:

- `scopus` -> official Scopus Search API
- `ieee` -> official IEEE Xplore Metadata API
- `acm` -> browser-driven extraction
- `google_scholar` -> browser-driven extraction, still experimental

### Adjustments made

1. Added local API key resolution in `src/lib/config.mjs`:
   - reads gitignored `config/keys.txt`
   - allows `SCOPUS_API_KEY` and `IEEE_API_KEY` to override local file values
2. Added `mode: "api"` support for source configs.
3. Reworked `scopus` and `ieee` adapters so they can execute against official APIs instead of Playwright.
4. Updated `config/sources.yml` so Scopus and IEEE now default to `api` mode.
5. Updated `doctor.mjs` so it validates:
   - `api_url` presence for api-mode sources
   - local API credential readiness for api-mode sources
6. Updated docs to reflect the new hybrid architecture and local key handling.

### Verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
```

Observed results:

- 12 tests passed, 0 failed
- `doctor.mjs` reports API credentials ready for api-mode sources

### External validation snapshot

One live validation was run outside the sandbox after the adapter changes:

- `scopus` returned records successfully through the official API
- `ieee` returned `HTTP 403` with `Developer Inactive`, indicating the supplied IEEE key is not currently active for metadata search in the upstream service
- `acm` remains browser-driven and can still return zero depending on current site behavior
- `google_scholar` remained browser-driven and returned records in that validation

## Local Environment File Setup

The credential-loading flow was then tightened so the repository supports both a tracked template and a private local key file.

### Adjustments made

1. Added a tracked `.env.example` file with placeholder entries for:
   - `SCOPUS_API_KEY`
   - `IEEE_API_KEY`
2. Added a local `.env` file in the working copy containing the user's real keys.
3. Kept `.env` ignored by git so the real credentials cannot be committed.
4. Kept `config/keys.txt` as a backward-compatible fallback, but changed the preferred local workflow to `.env`.
5. Added `src/lib/env.mjs` to parse `.env` and merge it with process environment variables.
6. Updated `src/lib/config.mjs` so API key resolution precedence is now:
   - process environment
   - local `.env`
   - local `config/keys.txt`
7. Updated docs and repo checks so the tracked template is part of the public contract.

### Intent

This satisfies the repository split the user requested:

- one env file that can be versioned safely as a template
- one env file that stays local with private credentials

## IEEE Activation Status and Remote Snapshot

After the API transition, the IEEE program team confirmed the current metadata key is still waiting for upstream activation.

### Operational status

- `scopus` is already usable through the official API
- `google_scholar` is enabled and usable as a browser-driven fallback source
- `ieee` is configured in the project but remains blocked until IEEE enables the key on their side
- `acm` remains browser-driven and best-effort

### IEEE note

The activation notice indicates the IEEE key is in `waiting` status and will only become usable after IEEE enables it during their business-hour activation window. No additional code change is currently required for `paper-ops`; the project only needs the upstream key status to change from inactive to active.

### Verification snapshot before release

The following commands were rerun before the latest repository snapshot was recorded:

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node test-all.mjs
npm run search:smoke
```

Observed results:

- 13 tests passed, 0 failed
- `test-all.mjs` passed with 2 expected warnings:
  - Gemini CLI not found in PATH for this environment
  - `dashboard/` still deferred
- fixture smoke search completed successfully and wrote fresh artifacts

### Git snapshot

- branch: `codex-review-remediation`
- commit: `bb6c210`
- commit message: `feat: expand paper-ops source integrations`
- pushed to: `origin/codex-review-remediation`

## README Clarification

The repository README was later refined to make dependency installation explicit instead of leaving it only implied in the quick-start block.

### Clarified points

- `npm install` is required because the project depends on `playwright`
- `npx playwright install chromium` is required for browser-driven sources
- Gemini CLI is optional and only needed for the interactive Gemini-first workflow
- `npm link` is optional and only affects local command ergonomics

## CSV Export by Search String

The repository then received a correction based on a user request captured from the UI:

- generating CSV from all `output/*.json` files together was too broad
- CSV export needed to be scoped by search string instead

### Adjustments made

1. Added `src/lib/csv-export.mjs` as the reusable CSV export layer.
2. Added `paper-ops csv "<query>"` to export a deduplicated CSV using only saved runs that match one search string.
3. Changed the export behavior to:
   - scan saved JSON outputs
   - filter by normalized query string
   - combine only matching runs
   - deduplicate combined records
   - write one CSV file back to `output/`
4. Replaced the hardcoded one-off scripts with reusable wrappers:
   - `json_to_csv.mjs` now exports one query passed by argument
   - `consolidate_all.mjs` now generates one CSV per distinct saved query
5. Updated the CLI help, Gemini prompt canonicalization, and README usage docs.

### Verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/csv-export.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/cli-surface.test.mjs
```

Observed results:

- CSV export tests passed
- CLI routing and Gemini prompt tests passed for the new `csv` surface

## README Credits and Google Scholar Pagination

The repository then received two follow-up improvements:

1. explicit credit in the README to the original base project
2. Google Scholar pagination so the live source can better honor the configured result limit per source

### Adjustments made

1. Updated `README.md` to:
   - credit [santifer/career-ops](https://github.com/santifer/career-ops) as the base project used to develop `paper-ops`
   - explain that `defaults.per_source_limit` in `config/sources.yml` controls how many articles are returned per source
   - document that Google Scholar now paginates until it reaches the configured limit or exhausts results
2. Added paginated Google Scholar extraction logic in `src/lib/adapters/google-scholar.mjs`.
3. Extended the browser runtime so one source search can reuse the same page while navigating successive result pages.
4. Added a regression test proving Google Scholar collects records beyond the first 10-result page when the configured limit is higher.

### Verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/browser-adapters.test.mjs
```

Observed results:

- Scholar pagination test passed
- existing browser adapter tests still passed

## Runtime Hardening: History Links, Per-Source Limits, and Artifact Collisions

After the Scholar pagination work, a follow-up hardening pass implemented the next set of recommended runtime fixes.

### Adjustments made

1. `search-history.md` links are now written relative to the history file location instead of relative to the repo root.
2. `verify.mjs` now validates history links relative to `data/search-history.md`, matching how markdown links actually resolve.
3. `pipeline` and `batch` now append stable suffixes to artifact IDs so duplicate queries in the same run no longer overwrite each other's report/JSON files.
4. Source-specific result limits are now supported:
   - `defaults.per_source_limit` remains the global default
   - `sources.<source>.limit` can override that default per source
5. Google Scholar pagination now also accepts source-specific pagination controls:
   - `max_pages`
   - `page_delay_ms`
6. README documentation was expanded to describe:
   - where to credit the base project
   - where to configure result limits
   - how per-source overrides work
   - how Scholar pagination is tuned

### Verification evidence

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/search-runner.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/browser-adapters.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/pipeline-batch.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node test-all.mjs
npm run search:smoke
```

Observed results:

- history-link regression tests passed
- per-source Scholar limit test passed
- pipeline and batch artifact-collision tests passed
- full unit suite passed
- `test-all.mjs` passed with the same 2 expected warnings
- fixture smoke search still passed

## PDF Reading and Article Summary V1

The next major capability added after search, CSV export, and digest hardening was the first end-to-end PDF reading and summary workflow.

### Goal

Move beyond metadata-only search results so the project can:

1. download accessible PDFs from saved query results
2. extract readable text from those PDFs
3. generate one structured summary per article
4. generate one cross-paper digest per saved search string

### Implementation decisions

1. Keep the search runtime as the first phase and run PDF/summary work as follow-up commands over saved query artifacts.
2. Add three explicit router surfaces:
   - `paper-ops fetch-pdfs <query>`
   - `paper-ops summarize <query>`
   - `paper-ops digest <query>`
3. Treat Gemini CLI as the default summarization runtime for:
   - structured per-article summaries
   - cross-paper digest synthesis
4. Require text-based PDFs only for V1.
   - No OCR yet for scanned/image-only PDFs.
5. Cache all downloaded and derived artifacts by stable article identity so reruns reuse existing files where possible.

### New artifact surfaces

- `output/pdfs/*.pdf`
- `output/pdf-text/*.txt`
- `output/article-summaries/*.json`
- `reports/article-summaries/*.md`
- `output/digests/*.json`
- `reports/digests/*.md`

### Implementation changes

1. Added `src/lib/pdf-extractor.mjs` for PDF text extraction.
2. Added `src/lib/article-summarizer.mjs` for:
   - Gemini CLI prompt execution
   - chunk-aware article summary synthesis
   - cross-paper digest synthesis
3. Added `src/lib/article-digest.mjs` for:
   - resolving saved query exports
   - PDF download/caching
   - text extraction/caching
   - per-article summary writing
   - digest writing
4. Extended the router and Gemini one-shot prompt builder for:
   - `fetch-pdfs`
   - `summarize`
   - `digest`
5. Extended terminal summaries to show PDF/text/summary workflow status and artifact directories.
6. Added `.env.example` entries for:
   - `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_CLI`
   - `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_TIMEOUT_MS`
7. Added `pdf-parse` as the PDF extraction dependency.
8. Extended `.gitignore` for generated PDF/text/summary/digest artifacts.
9. Updated:
   - `README.md`
   - `GEMINI.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `docs/SETUP.md`
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - plugin skill metadata
   - mode docs
10. Updated `doctor.mjs` to validate that the PDF parsing runtime is installed.

### Verification evidence

Red-first coverage was added for:

- new CLI mode routing
- Gemini prompt canonicalization for the new commands
- PDF fetch orchestration
- article summary generation
- cross-paper digest generation

The following commands passed after implementation:

```bash
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/search-runner.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/cli-surface.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/article-digest.test.mjs
node --test --test-isolation=none tests/*.test.mjs
node doctor.mjs
node verify.mjs
node test-all.mjs
npm run search:smoke
```

### Current limitations

1. `summarize` and `digest` require Gemini CLI by default.
2. OCR for scanned PDFs is still out of scope for this V1.
3. Downloading a PDF still depends on a direct accessible `pdf_url` already being present in the saved search results.

## Abstract Fallback for Summaries

After the first PDF-summary V1 landed, a gap was identified: some valid article results do not expose a direct PDF link, but they still expose usable abstract text either:

1. directly in the saved search/API record
2. on the article landing page itself

### Adjustment made

The summary pipeline was broadened so it now chooses the best available text source in this order:

1. extracted PDF text
2. saved `abstract` from the normalized `PaperRecord`
3. abstract enriched from the landing page HTML

### Implementation changes

1. `src/lib/article-digest.mjs` now:
   - persists the `text.source` used for each article
   - writes text artifacts even when the source is abstract-based rather than PDF-based
   - extracts landing-page abstracts from common metadata and abstract blocks when no PDF and no saved abstract are available
   - first tries a direct HTML fetch and then falls back to Playwright on the article page for dynamic content
2. `terminal-ui.mjs` now surfaces whether article text came from:
   - PDF
   - saved abstract
   - landing-page abstract
3. README and setup/architecture docs were updated to reflect the fallback order.

### Verification evidence

New red-first tests now cover:

- summarize from direct PDF text
- summarize from saved record abstract
- summarize from landing-page abstract
- digest generation when the set mixes those text sources

## Local Main Sync and Doctor Check

After syncing local `main` with `origin/main`, `node doctor.mjs` reported that the PDF parsing runtime was missing even though `pdf-parse` was declared in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### Correction made

1. Ran `npm.cmd install` to install missing local dependencies.
2. Confirmed `node_modules/pdf-parse`, `node_modules/@napi-rs/canvas`, and `node_modules/playwright` are present.
3. Kept the npm lockfile update that restores the optional `@napi-rs/canvas` package entries required by the `pdf-parse` dependency tree.

### Verification evidence

```bash
node doctor.mjs
```

Result: doctor checks passed with one warning: Gemini CLI is not installed in PATH, so Gemini-backed `summarize` and `digest` workflows still need Gemini CLI or a `PAPER_OPS_SUMMARY_CLI` override.

## Plain-Text Summary Artifacts and PDF Parser Compatibility

Follow-up review found local changes that add plain-text per-article summaries and adapt PDF extraction for `pdf-parse` 2.x.

### Adjustment made

1. `summarizeQueryArticles` now records `summary.textPath` and exposes `summaryTextDirectory` in returned artifacts.
2. Per-article summaries are written as:
   - structured JSON in `output/article-summaries/*.json`
   - plain text in `output/article-summaries/*.txt`
   - Markdown in `reports/article-summaries/*.md`
3. `extractTextFromPdfFile` now supports both older function-style `pdf-parse` exports and modern class-style `PDFParse` exports.
4. README, setup, and architecture docs now list the plain-text summary artifact.
5. `npm test` now uses Node's supported `--experimental-test-isolation=none` flag for the local Node.js runtime.

### Verification evidence

Focused tests were added for:

- classic `pdf-parse` function exports
- modern `PDFParse` class exports
- namespace exports containing `PDFParse`
- summary `.txt` artifact creation

## PDF-Grounded Question Answering

The next gap identified was that extracted PDF text needed to support direct research questions, not only pre-baked summaries and digests.

### Adjustment made

1. Improved PDF text extraction so it:
   - preserves page markers when `pdf-parse` returns page-level text
   - repairs common UTF-8 mojibake such as `â€™`
   - joins line-hyphenated words across PDF line breaks
   - calls `destroy()` on modern `PDFParse` parser instances
2. Added `paper-ops ask <query> --question <question>`.
3. The ask workflow reuses or creates the same PDF/abstract text artifacts used by `summarize`.
4. Answers are generated only from available PDF/abstract evidence and saved to:
   - `output/answers/*.json`
   - `reports/answers/*.md`
5. Added `--refresh-text` so old cached extracted text can be regenerated with the current extractor before `summarize`, `digest`, or `ask`.
6. Documentation, mode docs, CLI help, and agent instructions now include the `ask` command.

### Verification evidence

Focused tests cover:

- page-marker extraction
- mojibake repair
- parser cleanup with `destroy()`
- `ask` CLI routing
- answer artifact creation from extracted text

## SciELO and Web of Science Integration

The source catalog was expanded after the user requested explicit support for SciELO and Web of Science.

### Adjustment made

1. Added `scielo` as a free, no-auth API source using the SciELO Search JSON endpoint.
2. Added `web_of_science` as an API-mode source using `WEB_OF_SCIENCE_API_KEY` or `WOS_API_KEY`.
3. Updated `config/sources.yml` so both sources participate in normal `paper-ops search` runs.
4. Added fixtures and tests for SciELO live extraction and Web of Science API normalization.
5. Updated README, setup, architecture, doctor, and agent instructions to include the new source coverage.

### Operational notes

- SciELO uses `https://search.scielo.org/?format=json` by default and can still run in live browser mode if configured that way.
- Web of Science depends on the user's Clarivate API subscription and may require tuning `sources.web_of_science.api_url` in `config/sources.yml` if the account uses a different endpoint.

## Local SQLite RAG Database

The project was expanded from PDF/abstract question answering into a local, reusable RAG workspace for academic writing.

### Goal

After downloading or extracting article text, the user should be able to:

1. ask questions against the saved corpus
2. retrieve exact evidence chunks with page/source metadata
3. export references for writing
4. generate literature matrices and sourced draft sections

### Implementation decisions

1. Added `better-sqlite3` as the local database dependency.
2. Added `data/paper-ops.sqlite` as the default operational database path and ignored `data/*.sqlite*`.
3. Added idempotent schema creation for:
   - `search_runs`
   - `articles`
   - `documents`
   - `chunks`
   - `chunk_fts`
   - `answers`
   - `answer_evidence`
   - `references`
   - `embeddings`
4. Kept embeddings as a future extension; current retrieval uses local SQLite FTS5/BM25.
5. Added RAG commands:
   - `paper-ops db init`
   - `paper-ops index <query>`
   - `paper-ops ask <query> --question <question>`
   - `paper-ops evidence <query> --question <question>`
   - `paper-ops references <query>`
   - `paper-ops matrix <query>`
   - `paper-ops draft <query> --section <section> --question <focus>`
6. Changed public `ask` behavior to create/use the local RAG index instead of selecting chunks directly from all article text by token overlap.
7. Added citation verification so unsupported quotes are replaced with exact chunk text and marked as unverified.

### Verification evidence

The feature was implemented test-first. New coverage includes:

- SQLite schema idempotence
- query indexing into page-aware chunks and FTS
- FTS retrieval with article/page/DOI metadata
- RAG answer persistence and evidence verification
- ABNT and BibTeX export
- CLI routing for local RAG commands

Observed verification:

```bash
npm test
```

Result:

- 36 tests passed, 0 failed

## OCR and Semantic Retrieval Plan

The next architecture priority is to improve corpus coverage and retrieval quality.

### Planning decisions

1. OCR should be added as an optional text acquisition stage before RAG indexing.
2. The first OCR engine should be an `ocrmypdf` CLI adapter because Tesseract-based PDF OCR is more reliable when the PDF must keep page structure.
3. OCR artifacts should be written separately under `output/ocr-pdfs/*` and `output/ocr-text/*` so existing PDFs and extracted text are not overwritten.
4. Semantic retrieval should be added beside the existing SQLite FTS/BM25 path, not as a replacement.
5. The first semantic implementation should store vectors in SQLite and compute cosine/dot similarity in JavaScript, then add optional vector-index acceleration only if performance requires it.
6. Hybrid retrieval should combine BM25 and semantic ranks with reciprocal rank fusion so exact keyword matches and paraphrase matches both survive.

### Plan artifact

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-21-ocr-semantic-retrieval.md`

### Implementation outcome

The plan was implemented as a V1 extension to the local RAG system.

1. Added OCR schema and workflow support:
   - `ocr_runs`
   - `embedding_runs`
   - extended `embeddings` metadata
   - `output/ocr-pdfs/*`
   - `output/ocr-text/*`
2. Added `paper-ops ocr <query>` and `paper-ops index <query> --ocr`.
3. Added an OCRmyPDF adapter with test fakes so the normal test suite does not require a local OCR binary.
4. Added embedding providers:
   - deterministic `fixture` provider for tests
   - OpenAI-compatible provider for real semantic retrieval
5. Added `paper-ops embed <query>`.
6. Added semantic retrieval over stored chunk embeddings.
7. Added hybrid retrieval using BM25 plus semantic reciprocal rank fusion.
8. Added `--retrieval bm25|semantic|hybrid`, `--embed`, and `--refresh-embeddings` for `ask` and `evidence`.
9. Added retrieval quality metrics for precision@k, recall@k, and MRR.

## Autonomous & GUI Agents Literature Search

**Date:** 2026-09-24

Executed a multi-source academic paper search for autonomous agents, GUI/OS agents, computer-use agents, and desktop automation backed by LLMs/VLMs.

- **Query:** `("autonomous agent" OR "GUI agent" OR "OS agent" OR "computer use agent" OR "desktop agent") AND ("desktop automation" OR "GUI automation" OR "task execution" OR "computer control" OR "action space") AND ("large language model" OR "LLM" OR "vision-language model" OR "VLM" OR "multimodal agent")`
- **Total records retrieved:** 146 raw, 142 unique, 4 duplicates removed.
- **Source breakdown:**
  - Google Scholar: 100
  - Scopus: 25
  - IEEE Xplore: 11
  - Web of Science: 10
  - ACM: 0
  - SciELO: 0

## Academic Venue Quality Filtering and Ranking

**Date:** 2026-09-30

The search pipeline was extended to prefer academically relevant publication venues and limit returned material types.

### Data assessment

1. `docs/br-capes-acessos-portal-periodicos-2025-2026-06-01.xlsx` contains 455 institutional/UF access-metric rows. It does not identify journals or conferences and therefore is not used as venue-quality evidence.
2. `docs/journals_areas_2026-09-29_19-15-23.csv` contains 432 SciELO-style journal rows with areas, issue/volume recency, and active status. Three placeholder titles are excluded, leaving 429 catalog entries.
3. The SciELO catalog has no ISSN or Qualis column, so a match is labeled `scielo_indexed`, never `capes_validated`.
4. CAPES/Qualis and CORE remain separate optional CSV catalogs, with tracked header-only templates documenting their accepted schema.
5. `docs/doaj_journalcsv_20260830_2320_utf8.csv` contains 23,382 international open-access journal records with title, ISSN/eISSN, and review-process metadata; it is loaded as an independent DOAJ signal.

### Implementation decisions

1. Added `src/lib/academic-quality.mjs` for publication-type inference, catalog parsing, title/ISSN/acronym matching, academic scoring, filtering, and sorting.
2. Added strict and prioritize modes plus CLI overrides: `--quality-mode`, `--types`, and `--min-quality-score`.
3. Enabled strict filtering in `config/sources.yml` for journal articles, reviews, and conference papers with a minimum score of 40.
4. Preserved distinct evidence flags and reasons for CAPES/Qualis, SciELO, and international rankings.
5. Extended API adapters to retain publication-type and ISSN metadata when sources provide it.
6. Added quality summaries to terminal output, markdown reports, and JSON records.

### Verification evidence

- `npm test`: 62 passed, 0 failed.
- `node doctor.mjs`: completed successfully with four optional-runtime warnings (OpenDataLoader, OCRmyPDF, real embeddings, and external AI CLI).
- Catalog loading verified: 429 SciELO titles and 23,382 DOAJ titles.
- Cross-catalog fixture verified with `Scientia Agricola`, producing independent SciELO and DOAJ matches.
- `node verify.mjs` remains red because the existing `data/search-history.md` references historical report/JSON artifacts that are absent from the working tree. No saved history or artifacts were deleted or rewritten as part of this change.

## CAPES/Sucupira Catalog Synchronization

**Date:** 2026-09-30

Implemented `paper-ops catalog sync capes` as a bounded, auditable integration with the public Sucupira production API.

### Decisions

1. Discover valid year, type, and subtype keys from CAPES facets instead of hard-coding internal identifiers.
2. Default to the newest year returned by the API and allow `--year`, `--page-size`, and `--max-pages` overrides.
3. Keep only bibliographic journal articles and proceedings papers, with a client-side guard when type facets are temporarily unavailable.
4. Write the JSONL snapshot and provenance manifest atomically under `data/catalogs/capes/`.
5. Preserve synchronized records from other years when one year is refreshed.
6. Match search results by exact normalized title plus year and label the evidence `capes_production_registered`.
7. Never infer `capes_validated` from production registration; that flag remains reserved for an official Qualis venue match.

### Verification evidence

- `npm test`: 66 passed, 0 failed.
- `node doctor.mjs`: completed successfully with four optional-runtime warnings (OpenDataLoader, OCRmyPDF, real embeddings, and external AI CLI).
- `git diff --check`: passed; only the repository's existing Windows line-ending notices were emitted.
- Catalog tests cover facet discovery, scholarly subtype filtering, unavailable years, CLI routing, and incremental refresh without dropping previously synchronized years.
